								<h3>Experience</h3>
								<p>I've had multiple experiences in teaching, with some that correlate 
									to Visual arts teaching. During the back end of 2023, I had the 
									opportunity to assist Sydney Catholic Schools in a Visual Arts 
									Workshop that assisted then year 12 students with their Visual Arts 
									HSC Major works. This allowed me to have some insight into the 
									range of understandings of what a Visual Art needs in order to 
									fully assist in their students in fully developing and realising 
									the grnadest potential of their body's of work.</p>
								<p>As well as this, I also had experience in the teaching within the 
									public primary sector, as I taught scripture to a class of year 5 
									at Burraneer Public Primary, as part of the (then De La Salle) St 
									Aloysius Catholic College Cronulla catechism outreach program with 
									local public primary schools, in partnership with the local parish 
									of St Aloysius Gonzaga Catholic Church.</p>
									<ul class="actions special">
										<li><a href="https://www.theleader.com.au/story/7629755/forget-traditional-scripture-this-is-innovative-learning/" class="button">Learn More</a></li>
									</ul>
									<p>In teaching within both the Primary and Secondary sectors, 
										I was able to have a full grasp of the ins and outs of the 
										role of teachers within their classrooms. To further link 
										with my teaching philosophy; The role of an educator is 
										guide students to achieve their fullest potential no matter 
										their ability.</p>
								<h3>Teaching Placement Experience</h3>
								<p>So far during my college schooling at ACU (Australian Catholic 
									University) Strathfield, I was able to have the opportunity to 
									go on a Teaching Placement during June of 2024. I was assigned 
									to assist in Visual Arts Teaching at St Mauron's Maronite College 
									Marrickville, a preschool to year 12, where I was teaching roughly 
									1-2 lessons a day. During my placement I had the opportunity to 
									teach grades 7, 10 and 12. All classes allowed to have a grasp 
									of the different range of learning abilities, in further to fully 
									understand students and how they learn within a Visual Arts learning 
									environemnt.</p>
									<p>Throughout my placement, I was also able to be mentored by my 
										supervising teacher, Mr Mark Lunnon, who was able to guide me 
										in ways and methods in improving my approach to pedagogy and 
										to better build a professional rapport with students to keep 
										them engaged with learning the content.</p>
