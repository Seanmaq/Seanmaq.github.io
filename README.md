A light, slick, modern, responsive, adjective-drenched design built around an extremely
dynamic landing page (scroll that mofo!). Inspired by Big Picture, another design
of mine with a similarish feel/flow, only this time I took it waaaaaay further and
actually made it multipurpose (versus copping out and making it a one pager like I
did last time ;) Includes multiple pages, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and all
its Sass sources.


All navigation points run in a nice tidy cycle. If you're at one page you'll always have the opportunity to travel back to the main page or any of the other previous pages you've been too. The excemption to this rule is if you're visiting any other external websites linked throughout the page.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
